     <h2 id="aboutMe"> Profile </h2>
        <p>I am a Computer Science graduate from Middlesex University London. I have acquired various employability skills through working in different retails and hospitality sector. I have also worked about one and half year as a Community Operations Analyst with CPL Solutions on site Facebook, where I have built my strong communication skills and organisational skills.
I am interested in a career in technology because it is an opportunity to combine my analytical skills with my creative abilities. As a software engineer, I believe that technology represents unlimited possibilities.</p>
      
    <h2> Experience </h2>
      <p>I have gained work experience in computer servicing and enterprise workshop, when I studied at College of Northwest London such as installing and configuring computer hardware and software, operating systems and applications, monitoring and maintaining computer systems and networks, troubleshooting system and network problems, diagnosing and solving hardware or software faults.<br>
Moreover, I have developed a car rental and sales system for a small business company in my home town during my final year project at uni. It was a bespoke software which was developed by Java programming language and MySQL database. The project aim was to replace the current manual system. This project involved from scratch to an end such as project background, problem statement, system requirements, software development and project reflection. This project has enhanced my IT skills and knowledge of the software development lifecycle and learning project experience.<br>
I achieved ITIL foundation, CompTia A+ and Network + certificates in last couple of year to update my troubleshooting and networking skills during pandenmic.</p>
   
   <h2> Goal </h2>
      <p>My goal is to become a software engineer near future. I would like to get back in track in IT industry where I left out after my degree. I believe that gaining and completing CYF full stack course is  stepping stone to enter into the IT industry and will develop my coding and professional skills. I have an analytical mind, a love of technology, boundless enthusiasm, plus a desire to learn to progress in terms of responsibilities and career prospects.</p>
